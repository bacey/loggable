Usage:

```
mvn clean verify
java -jar target/loggable-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar
```

You can also import the project in Eclipse using m2e and run the Foo class. You just have to build it once because m2e ignores the jcabi-maven-plugin plugin, that is, there isn't a m2e configurator for that.
